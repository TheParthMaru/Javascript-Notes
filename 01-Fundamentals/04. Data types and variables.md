# Data types in JS

- We have two types of data in JS:
  - Primitive data types
  - Object

## Primitive data types

### Number

- Numeric data type containing floating point values as well.

### String

- Used for storing text.
- Anything between single or double quotes can be considered as `string`.

```js
console.log("Parth");
```

- Here `parth` is a string.

### Boolean

- Logical data type that can be either `true` or `false`.

### Undefined

- Value taken by a variable that is not defined.

### Null

- Also means empty value.

### Symbol

- Defines a value that is unique and cannot be changed.

### BigInt

- Larger numbers greater than Number type can hold.

# Variables

- Names or alias to a memory location where data is stored so that we can refer to that memory location.
- You can consider it as a storage space for storing data.

## `let`

- Used to create variables.

```js
// Syntax for creating a variable
let variableName = value;
```

## `const`

- Used to create constant values which cannot be modified or updated later.

```js
const PI = 3.142;
```

## Variable declaration, definition, initialization

```js
// Declaring a variable
let firstName;

// Initializing a variable
firstName = "Parth";

// Defining a variable
let lastName = "Maru";

// Re-initializing a variable
firstName = "Lily";

// As JS is dynamic language, you can re-initialize a variable with a different type
firstName = 65.98; // Allowed
```

- A constant needs to be defined everytime else it will result in error.
- Also you cannot re-initialize a constant.

```js
const PI; // Declaring of const is not allowed

const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.142; // Re-initializing of  a const is not allowed
```

## Variable nameing conventions

- We need to follow camelCase naming convention for naming a variable.
- A variable needs to start with either
  - an alphabet (`a-z` and `A-Z`) or
  - Dollar (`$`) or
  - Underscore (`_`)
- Anything apart from the above 3 is considered as a bad practice and one should avoid it.
- Variable names should be meaningful and not any already existing keywords in JS.

### Valid variable names

```js
let firstName = "parth";
let age = 25;
let salary = 23000.0;
let isMarried = false;
let $randomVariable = 69;
let _isParkingAvailable = true;
```

### Invalid variable name

```js
let 3years = 3;
let e@mail = "abc@xyz.com";
let const = "constant";
```
