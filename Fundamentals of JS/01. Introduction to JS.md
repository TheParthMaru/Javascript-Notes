# Introduction to Javascript
- Modern language to make web pages dynamic.
- Javascript was initially called as Livescript but later its name got changed to Javascript because of popularity of Java.
- Javascript is not at all related to Java.
- Javascript can execute on any device that has Javascript engine on it.
- Two most popular engines are:
    - V8 =>  Chrome, Opera, Edge, etc.
    - Spider monkey =>  Firefox.

- Javascript can execute on both browser as well as server.
- It has full integration with HTML and CSS.

## How does JS engine works?
- The engine parses or reads the code.
- It gets converted to machine code.
- This machine code is executed by the browser or the server.
- The engine also applies optimizations to the code while its executing.

## What can in-browser Javascript do?
- Add HTML, add dynamic content, modify css.
- React to user actions.
- Send requests to the server.
- Download or upload files.
- Get and set cookies.
- Store local data on the client side i.e., local storage.

## What in-browser Javascript can't do?
- Cannot read or write the files on the hard disk.
- No OS functionality.
- Different tabs or windows do not know about each other.
- These can be achieved on server side using Node.js
