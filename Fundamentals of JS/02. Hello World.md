# Hello World in Javascript

- We have different ways to write Javascript as follows:

## Using `<script>` tag
- Used to insert JS code into an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            alert("Hello World");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

- The `alert()` function is a built-in function that is used to create a modal with content in it.
- The `<script>` tag contains the Js code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

## Using external scripts
- If we have a lot of js code, we can put it into a seperate file and attach it to HTML with `src` attribute in `<script>` tag.

```js
// Create a script.js file and write your code
// script.js
alert("Hello World");

// index.html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <body>
        <script src = "/path/to/script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

- As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML and more complex ones reside in separate files.
- The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
- Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once which reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

### Note:
- If `src` attribute is set then `<script>` content is ignored.

```js
<script src="./script.js">
    alert("Hi");
</script>
```

- In the above code, `alert("Hi")` is ignored and won't be executed as the script at the path attached to `src` will be executed.
- In order to run js locally we need to install `node.js`
